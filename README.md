## ActivitySim - A Stochastic Model for Residential User Activity Simulation

Residential user activities play a crucial role in the energy management of buildings.  However, it is often difficult to obtain detailed and sufficient size of activity data  for user behaviour study, user thermal comfort, estimation of energy consumption, and more. In this project, we create a Markov chain based stochastic model for residential user activity simulation. This activity data generator has to be trained using Time Use Survey (TUS) data set (in this case Danish TUS was used), then users can generate activity sequences with any of the size.
